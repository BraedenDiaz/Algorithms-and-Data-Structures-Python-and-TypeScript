/**
 * Solves the Knapsack Problem. The goal is to maximize the total value of items while remaining
 * within the weight limit of our knapsack.
 * 
 * Runtime: O(2^n) - In the worst case, each step would require us to evaluate two subproblems,
 * sometimes repeatedly, as thereâ€™s overlap between subproblems. We can drastically improve on this
 * runtime by using dynamic programming. See the next function.
 * 
 * @param weightCap The total amount of weight you can carry.
 * @param weights The weights of all of the items in an array.
 * @param values The values of all of the items in an array.
 * @param i Where we are in the list of items. Default: The length of weights or values which represent
 * the number of items and should be the same. I.e. the end of the list of items.
 * @returns The maximum value that we will be able to carry in our knapsack.
