# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Python-and-TypeScript

A repository of algorithms and data structures based on the [Learn Data Structures and Algorithms with Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-with-python) course on Codecademy.

The course was followed to help create the algorithms and data structures in Python.

I then decided to recreate the same algorithms and data structures in TypeScript in order to get some practice with and give examples of these same algorithms and data structures in a typed programming language.
